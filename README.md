Resume Workspace is a MVC application set up to store categorical resume information. There are five main categories of information (Employment, Education, Certifications, Skills, and Affiliations). The Employment category has a sub-category of Positions, which in turn has sub-categories of Accomplishments and Contacts.

Each main category has a model, controller, and views set up to facilitate the viewing, adding, updating, and deleting of records. An outstanding issue deals with getting the Position model to save periodically (submit HTML form) when additions and deletions are made to Accomplishments and Contacts within the Position view. 

To run the application, download all files and open the ResumeWorkspace.sln solution within the ‘src’ folder. In Debug configuration, select the desired browser to connect to (or hit Ctrl F5).
